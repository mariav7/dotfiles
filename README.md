## Dotfiles

These are my configuration files for various tools, including: [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and more.
Feel free to explore, use, and adapt these configurations to suit your sauce :stew:

I've crafted these dotfiles by drawing inspiration from other talented individuals in the open-source community.
Exploring and learning from their configurations has been instrumental in shaping my own setup.
Now, I'm sharing my dotfiles with the hope that they might be useful or inspiring to others.
